- FILE = file structure

- FILE * cfPtr; //file pointer

- cfPtr = fopen("clients.txt","w") //returns file pointer
	- opens file, w = write, r = read, a = append

- while(feof(stdin)) = looks for end of file

- fprintf(cfPtr,"content"); //writes data to file
- fscanf(cfPtr); //scans from file

-rewind(); sends pointer back to beginning of file

Random access files
- Save data is equally sized chunks of memory
- use fwrite(); and fread();
- fseek(FILE *,long int offset, int whence);
	- whence = SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END

- 10001
- 1's complement = 01110
- 2's complement = 01111 (add one)

- all "complements" are opposite in most significant bit (MSB)
	- starts with 0 = positive
	- starts with 1 = negative

- converting from negative to positive uses the same process as positive to negative

3-bit computing w/ 2's complement:
000 = 0
001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = -4
101 = -3
110 = -2
111 = -1
